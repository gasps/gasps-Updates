Sirius, the leading script that boasts unparalleled user experience, smart features, and an impressive interface, has just announced three new updates and releases that are set to revolutionize the experience for users.

First on the list is Sirius' recent addition of two popular games, Tower of Hell and Murder Mystery 2, to its ever-expanding list of supported games. This move is a significant milestone for the script as it opens up new possibilities for users looking to enhance their experience in these popular games.

But that's not all. Sirius is also adding support for two more games, Frontlines and Bad Business, which further empowers our Pro and Essential users. For Bad Business, the Sirius team has completely rewritten the game script and added high-quality, overpowered features that are sure to blow users' minds. These will be available in the coming days or hours, used with the Loader.

Furthermore, we are releasing a new user interface for Sirius Sense, which uses our unrivaled Rayfield Interface Suite. The interface for Sense promises to be more intuitive, user-friendly, and customizable than ever before, providing users with a seamless and immersive experience while playing.

Try out the new release below:

At Sirius, we take pride in providing our users with the best experience possible. That's why we are constantly innovating and pushing the boundaries to make our script the best of its kind. With these new updates and releases, we believe we've taken a huge step towards achieving that goal.

If you haven't tried Sirius yet, now is the perfect time to do so. With our cutting-edge features and impressive user interface, we guarantee you won't be disappointed.

In addition, we are excited to announce that Sirius Beta 2, a major update with even more features and improvements, is imminent, and set to release soon. We are also hard at work on Sirius Guard, our proprietary whitelist that will provide an added layer of security and exclusivity for our users. With these upcoming releases, we are committed to providing our users with the best possible experience and ensuring that Sirius remains at the forefront of the scripting industry.

Stay tuned for more updates and releases from Sirius, as we continue to redefine the scripting experience.
