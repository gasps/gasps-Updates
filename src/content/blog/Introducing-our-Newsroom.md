Introducing the Newsroom: The one-stop shop for all Sirius Updates, New Features, and Announcements

We're thrilled to announce the launch of Newsroom, our new place to keep you up-to-date with everything you need to know about Sirius. From new updates to exciting features and important announcements, Sirius is your one-stop destination for all things related to our product.

With Newsroom, you'll have access to a wealth of information that will help you make the most of Sirius, Rayfield and more. Whether you're a new user or a long-time customer, you'll find valuable insights, tips, and tricks that will enhance your experience and make your life easier.

And the best part? You'll get all this information in one convenient place. No more scouring the internet for updates or searching through multiple channels to find what you're looking for. Newsroom is your go-to source for all the latest news and updates about Sirius.

But don't worry, Sirius Newsroom won't be replacing our Discord announcements channel. While our blog will be the primary place for major announcements and updates, our Discord channel will still be used for smaller announcements, polls, and community engagement.

We can't wait to share all the exciting things we have in store for you!
