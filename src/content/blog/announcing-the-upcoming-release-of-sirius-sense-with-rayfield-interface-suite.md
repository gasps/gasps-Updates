We're excited to announce that our high-performance ESP script, Sirius Sense, will soon be released with our beautiful UI library, Rayfield Interface Suite. This exciting combination will make it easier for our users to utilize the power of Sirius Sense in-game without needing to have any knowledge of programming or experience in Rayfield Interface Suite development.

Sirius Sense is an ESP script that enhances the gameplay experience by providing users with the ability to see other players and objects through walls and terrain in almost all games on the platform. With its high performance and unrivaled accuracy, Sirius Sense is trusted by many to gain a competitive advantage and improve their experience.

Rayfield Interface Suite, on the other hand, is a UI library that provides a comprehensive set of tools and components for building stunning and functional scripts. With Rayfield, you can create scripts to go along with our beautiful and responsive interface that is optimized for performance and user experience.

Together, Sirius Sense and Rayfield Interface Suite will offer users a flexible and robust solution to enhance their gameplay and personalize their Sirius Sense configuration.

We're excited to make Sense more accessible to a wider audience, and it won't be long before we do. Stay tuned for more updates on the release date and how to get started.
